Type-safe callbacks
Many-to-many relationship
Implemented in QObject
Slots are automatically disconnected when the receiver is deleted.
Only connect the signals you need, while in a listener you need to implement also the methods you won't use.
You can directly connect signals to slots, without having to implement a listener method calling another method
When implementing your own signals/slots, there is no need to do the listener management yourself as this is done by the qt object system

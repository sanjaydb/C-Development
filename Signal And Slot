Type-safe callbacks
Many-to-many relationship
Implemented in QObject
Slots are automatically disconnected when the receiver is deleted.
Only connect the signals you need, while in a listener you need to implement also the methods you won't use.
You can directly connect signals to slots, without having to implement a listener method calling another method
When implementing your own signals/slots, there is no need to do the listener management yourself as this is done by the qt object system

Signal
A signal is a way to inform a possible observer that something happened.
  A QPushButton is clicked.
  An asynchronous service handler is finished.
  Signal is sent, or emitted, using the keyword "emit".
  
Slot
A slot is a function that is to be executed when a signal has been emitted.

Connecting Signals and Slots
To setup the signal-slot connection, we must first determine the connection.
Syntax: connect(sender, SIGNAL(signal), receiver, SLOT(slot)));

We are conducting a study on ransomware creation to gain a deeper understanding of their mechanisms and effectively combat them.
Our intention is solely for educational purposes, and no permission is granted to cause harm to any other systems. 
Our goal is to enhance knowledge and contribute towards creating a safer world.
If anyone chooses to use or misuse the information provided for creating ransomware, 
it will be solely their responsibility for their actions. I hold no responsibility for any such misuse. - Sanjay Bhalerao.

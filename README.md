# C-Development

Small code in ansci C is written for learning and understanding C language

I will try my level best to create simple code in C as possible as I can. 

Truly speaking C is really simple Language, if we understand Structures and String Properly.

Once  you understand handling string properly, I feel you will never use other language.

Lets Rock.
